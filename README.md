# SimpleWebNX
A shitty HTML renderer for the Nintendo Switch based on tinyxml2.  
Don't use this.. like really, just use the built-in applet instead.

Doesn't even render a simple website.

## Features
* Tries to render your shitty site, but fails
* Javasc.... ahahah good joke
* CSS? who needs that, do I look like a fucking hipster to you
